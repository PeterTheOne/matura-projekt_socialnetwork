matura-projekt_socialnetwork
============================

matura-projekt_socialnetwork was the project I did for my computer-science 
matura (high-school leaving exam) at [BRG Viktring](http://brg-viktring.at). 
The project is a minimal version of a socialnetwork. Fuctions are: register 
user, add friend, approve friendship, list users, write on 'wall'. The Outputs 
are focused on showing what happens in the code.
